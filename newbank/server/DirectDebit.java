/*
This class supports the implementation of direct debit payments
A direct debit is associated with an account (the account from which the direct debit is being made)
To set up the direct debit the following information is needed:
--> The amount of money required to be paid per month on the direct debit
--> The day of the month which the direct debit is being paid
--> The account to which the direct debit is being paid (from account is the account the
    direct debit is associated with)
--> The end date of the direct debit (start date is the date when the direct debit is created)
